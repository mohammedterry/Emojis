# Emojis :) xD ;P ^^ ~_~ >:(
Adds that personal touch to the bot

## Expressing Itself
The bot can express its current mood level using a relevant emoji.
Mood levels can range from super positive (+14) to extremely negative (-14)

## Guessing Moods
The bot can also guess the mood of an emoji 
+1 positive / 0 neutral / -1 negative
and can then respond appropriately!

## Emoji Facial Recognition
It can detect an emoji embedded in text

## Random Emoji Generator
And finally it can generate random emojis
some with noses, tears, eyebrows, etc

# Updates - including Modern Emojis!

The Emoji class has now been modified to interpret, generate and understand modern unicode emojis!

Including flowers, hearts, animals, etc - the whole shabang!

## Detecting Emojis

## Generating Emojis
Like before, random ASCII emojis can be generated - some of which are able to be 'modernised'

## interpreting meaning and mood
Alternatively, modern emojis can be generated randomly and their meaning analysed to return a mood score

## Automatically adding emojis into a sentence
Modern emojis can automatically replace words in a sentence to add creativity or to exemplify things

## Encryption
An interesting side-effect discovered was to use emojis (unicode) as a way of displaying sensitive information - like passwords - which can be easily read and understood by the user - but not easily copied and pasted!

## Mood range
The range of moods has been increased from -/+ 14 to -/+ 40!!!

## 3D Emotion
However, the old style of classifying mood as positive or negative was very binary in nature - and difficult to explain the vast array of possible moods the bot could show.  
A new system of mood / emotion involves a more 3D classification of moods 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohammedterry/Emojis/master/screenshots/mood3Dtheory.jpg)

So this works by constantly updating three values (shown in the table above) - and the 3 truth values combined will determine which of 8 base emotions the bot (or user) is likely in.
e.g. One of these 8 emotions is "fear".  Here are a selections of emojis which can be chosen by the bot in this emotional state:

## Analytics
There is also a function which analyses the emojis in a text and returns the various emotions involved

## Safeguarding
This can also act as a smart filter - i.e. if there is too much of an inapropriate or sensitive category detected (e.g. violence, sex, religion, insults, etc)

## Mini-Games
Now includes one simple minigame - odd one out (guess the emoji that doesnt fit into the same category as the the others)
Hoping to implement some more medical themed mini-games too
